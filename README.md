This project involves building a responsive and dynamic news website using front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website fetches real-time news data from a news API, providing users with the latest headlines, articles, and updates across various categories like politics, sports, technology, entertainment, and more.
Key Features:
Responsive Design: The website is designed using HTML and CSS, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly across all devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).

Dynamic Content: JavaScript is used to fetch data from an external news API (such as the News API or any other publicly available API) to display the latest news articles dynamically. The website updates its content in real time without requiring manual updates.

Category Filtering: Users can filter news articles by categories (e.g., Business, Sports, Technology) using interactive buttons or dropdown menus. JavaScript handles the filtering logic to show the relevant articles based on the user's selection.

Search Functionality: A search bar allows users to enter keywords and search for specific news articles. The JavaScript function sends a request to the API with the search query and displays the matching results.

Interactive Elements: The website incorporates various interactive elements, such as a carousel or slideshow for featured news, hover effects, and animations, all achieved through CSS and JavaScript.

API Integration: The site Fetch API calls in JavaScript to connect with the news API, retrieve the latest data, and handle any errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.

User Interface (UI) Components: The website includes various UI components like a navigation bar, footer, and sidebar with social media links and additional news sections, all styled with CSS for a cohesive look.

Technical Stack:
HTML: To structure the web pages and content.
CSS: For styling and layout, including Flexbox/Grid for responsiveness.
JavaScript: For interactivity, API calls, and dynamic content management.
News API: For fetching real-time news data.
